# Volumetric Modeling of Periacetabular Osteotomy Fragment Fixation
This tool simulates the insertion of screws and K-wires for fixation of a periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) fragment.
Shapes and poses of the inserted objects are randomly computed.
The insertion is performed volumetrically in order to enable realistic simulation studies.

A comprehensive listing of the program's usage may be obtained by passing `-h` or `--help`.

Several demonstrations of this tool are given in the walkthrough [here](https://github.com/rg2/xreg/wiki/Walkthrough%3A-Volumetric-Modeling-of-Screws-and-Wires-for-PAO).
